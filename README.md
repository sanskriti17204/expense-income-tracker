# expense-income-tracker

This repository contains the source code for a desktop application designed to help users efficiently manage and track their personal or small business expenses and income.

# Problem Statement
In an increasingly complex financial landscape, individuals and small businesses often struggle with manually tracking their daily financial transactions. This can lead to difficulties in budgeting, identifying spending patterns, and accurately assessing financial health. The lack of a simple, intuitive tool for logging and summarizing financial data can result in financial oversight and hinder effective financial planning.

This application addresses these challenges by providing a user-friendly interface to quickly record income and expenses, offering a clear overview of financial flow, and enabling easy data export for further analysis.

Real-time Financial Overview: The application provides immediate updates on the current balance, total income, and total expenses, giving users a clear snapshot of their financial standing.

Transaction Display: All recorded transactions are displayed in a clear, tabular format, making it easy to review historical data.

Data Export Functionality: Users can export their financial data to a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file, facilitating further analysis in spreadsheet software or for record-keeping purposes.

Reset Functionality: A "Reset All" option allows users to clear all transaction data, useful for starting fresh or managing different financial periods.

# Technologies Used
Java: The core programming language used for developing the application's logic and backend functionalities.

Swing: A graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit for Java, used to build the interactive and responsive desktop application interface.

AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): Utilized for fundamental GUI operations and integration, forming the basis for some of the graphical components within the Swing framework.
